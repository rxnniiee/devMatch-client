This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Client side for devMatch

To run the project:
```bash
npm start
```

## **Things to keep in mind:**

- Redux is used for state that is shared between components
- Internal state is used for state that is needed only for that specific component

- Main headers on pages are h3

## Redux state structure

```js
state: {
    employee: {
        id: number,
        username: string,
        matches: object[],
    },
    employer: {
        id: number,
        companyName: string,
        openPositions: [
            {
                position: string,
                matches: object[],
            }
        ]
    }
}
